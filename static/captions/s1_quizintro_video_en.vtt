00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
Welcome to the Bionic Eye Quiz Show,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.290
the game that tests your knowledge of

00:00:04.527 --> 00:00:06.987
bionic eyes as well as your own vision.

00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:10.081
Bionic eyes are implanted devices designed

00:00:10.373 --> 00:00:12.123
to bypass severe vision loss.

00:00:12.505 --> 00:00:14.385
Even though current technology provides

00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:17.115
only limited sight, users can recognize

00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:19.992
light, shadow and shapes. In the future,

00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:21.914
bionic eyes might be as good as,

00:00:22.208 --> 00:00:24.518
if not better than, biological eyes.

00:00:24.752 --> 00:00:26.742
This game consists of eight

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:29.093
multiple-choice questions. The computer

00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:30.705
will keep track of your score

00:00:30.794 --> 00:00:32.244
at the bottom of the screen.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.479
Are you ready to play?

00:00:33.524 --> 00:00:35.508
