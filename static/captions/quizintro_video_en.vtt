Welcome to the Bionic Eye Quiz Show:

00:00:02.874 --> 00:00:04.804
the game that tests your knowledge of

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:07.211
bionic eyes as well as your own vision.

00:00:08.048 --> 00:00:10.698
Bionic eyes are implanted devices designed

00:00:10.853 --> 00:00:12.903
to bypass severe vision loss.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.939
Even though current technology provides

00:00:16.028 --> 00:00:18.838
only limited sight, users can recognize

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:21.426
light, shadow, and shapes.

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:24.482
In the future, bionic eyes might be

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:28.249
as good as, if not better than, biological eyes.

00:00:28.976 --> 00:00:30.756
This game consists of eight

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.319
multiple-choice questions.

00:00:32.753 --> 00:00:35.063
The computer will keep track of your score

00:00:35.154 --> 00:00:36.594
at the bottom of the screen.

00:00:37.014 --> 00:00:38.494
Letâ€™s get started.
