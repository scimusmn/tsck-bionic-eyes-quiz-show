00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.667
Now let's try a video simulation.

00:00:03.074 --> 00:00:04.844
I'm going to show you a video

00:00:05.043 --> 00:00:06.493
that mimics a bionic eye,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.920
but with fewer electrodes,

00:00:08.068 --> 00:00:09.710
producing a cruder image.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.068
Let's see what you can make out.
