00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.637
Now let's try a video simulation.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.610
I'm going to show you a video

00:00:04.775 --> 00:00:06.085
that mimics a bionic eye,

00:00:06.348 --> 00:00:07.718
but with fewer electrodes,

00:00:07.991 --> 00:00:09.521
producing a cruder image.

00:00:09.938 --> 00:00:12.068
Let's see what you can make out.
